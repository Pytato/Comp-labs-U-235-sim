# Comp-labs-U-235-sim
Monte Carlo simulations of various topologies formed of pure U-235.

This project was focussed on establishing the critical dimensions of pure Uranium 235 in various topologies (not very realistic, I know). 

Gradually being updated to allow for `multiprocessing` support, will utilise `cpu_count() - 2` processes to give your CPU some room to do other things.
